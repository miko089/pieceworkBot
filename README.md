# pieceworkBot

A bot for people who receive a percentage of the money received by the company. You can
just add the percentage you want to receive and the bot will evaluate
the amount you will receive (including taxes). Bot is localized in Russian only.
It's available at [@pieceworkWagerBot](http://t.me/pieceworkWagerBot). If you want to localize it or make a copy, put 
bot token in .env file (BOT_TOKEN) and install requirements with
```commandline
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
and run the bot with
```commandline
python main.py
```
